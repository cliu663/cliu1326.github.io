        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Sophomore at Bob Jones University studying Cinema Production but planning to change it to Business Marketing. I enjoy being a dorm student, because of this I get to know more people from my school.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active in my local church: Southside Baptist Church of Gaffney, SC.  I teach Sunday School for the College &amp; Career group and I run the Sound / Video Projection System during services.  I also drive the church bus for weekend activities.

         <p>
            To become a director use to be my dream

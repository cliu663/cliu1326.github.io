         <p>I am a Sophomore at Bob Jones University studying Cinema Production but planning to change it to Business Marketing. I enjoy being a dorm student, because of this I get to know more people from my school. The church that usually go is Morningside Baptist church. </p>
         <p>
         To come to Us to study is probaly the best choice that I have every made. The past 3 years have been learning a lot about the Culture of the Unites States, and I came to a point that I think US is the best country you can ever live in.
